## FAQs

**Does the app work without an account?**  
Yes for local control in many setups, but cloud sync and remote access may require an account.

**Can multiple family members use the same devices?**  
Yes. Devices can be shared via invitation or account sharing (implementation may vary).

**How do I transfer a device to a new owner?**  
Use “Remove / Unclaim” in the app (or perform a factory reset) so the next user can claim it.
