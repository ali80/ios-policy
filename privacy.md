## Summary

We design the app to work with **minimal personal data**. Some data is required to provide core features like device ownership, cloud sync, notifications, and troubleshooting.

<div class="callout"><strong>In short:</strong> we use your data to run the app, keep your devices connected, and improve reliability. We don’t sell your personal data.</div>

## Data we collect

### 1) Account and contact information (optional)
If you create an account, we may collect:

- Email address and/or phone number
- Account identifiers (user ID)
- Region and preferred language

If you use the app without an account, some features may be unavailable (e.g., cloud sync across devices).

### 2) Device and app information
To connect to your IoT devices and support the app, we may collect:

- Device identifiers (device ID, model, firmware version)
- Connectivity metadata (online/offline status, last sync time)
- App version, OS version, device type
- Crash logs and performance metrics (when enabled)

### 3) Usage and automation data
Depending on features you enable:

- Schedules and automation rules you create
- Command history (e.g., “turn on”, “run schedule”) for troubleshooting
- Notification preferences

### 4) Sensor and telemetry data (depends on device)
If your hardware supports it:

- Sensor readings (e.g., humidity, temperature, flow, pressure)
- Battery level, power status
- Diagnostic events (e.g., valve error, calibration status)

## How we use your data

We use information to:

- Provide core functionality (connect devices, execute commands, sync settings)
- Maintain security and prevent fraud/abuse
- Send notifications you request (alerts, status changes)
- Diagnose issues, fix bugs, and improve performance
- Comply with legal obligations

## Sharing and disclosure

We may share limited information with:

- **Infrastructure providers** (hosting, databases, analytics, crash reporting) to operate the service
- **Notification services** to deliver push notifications
- **Legal authorities** if required by law or to protect users and the service

We do **not** sell personal information.

## Data retention

We retain data only as long as needed:

- Account data: while your account is active (or as required by law)
- Device telemetry: retained for a limited period for app functionality and troubleshooting
- Logs: retained for a limited period then deleted or aggregated

## Security

We use industry-standard safeguards such as encryption in transit and access controls. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve protections.

## Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access your data
- Correct your data
- Delete your account and associated data
- Export certain data

See **Privacy Choices**: [/privacy-choices/](/privacy-choices/)

## Children

The app is not intended for children under the age required by local law to consent to data processing. Do not use the app if you are under that age.

## Changes

We may update this policy. We’ll revise the “Last updated” date above and, when appropriate, notify you in the app.
