## Manage your data

You can typically manage your information in the app:

- View and edit profile details
- Manage notification preferences
- Remove (unclaim) devices

## Request a data export

Email **privacy@mydomain.com** with subject: **“Data export request”**  
Include the email/phone used for your account.

## Delete your account

**Option A (recommended): In-app deletion**  
If the app includes an “Delete account” button, use it to permanently delete your account.

**Option B: Request deletion by email**  
Email **privacy@mydomain.com** with subject: **“Account deletion request”**  
Include:
- The email/phone used for your account
- Confirmation you want deletion

<div class="callout"><strong>What gets deleted:</strong> account identifiers and associated cloud data. Some records may be retained if required by law or for security (e.g., abuse prevention) for a limited period.</div>

## Device transfer / ownership

To transfer a device to someone else:
- Remove it from your account (unclaim)
- Or factory reset the device (if supported)
