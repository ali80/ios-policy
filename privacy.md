## Summary

We design the app to work with **minimal personal data**. Some data is required to provide core features like device ownership, cloud sync, notifications, and troubleshooting.

<div class="callout"><strong>In short:</strong> we use your data to run the app, keep your devices connected, and improve reliability. We don’t sell your personal data.</div>

## Data we collect

### 1) Account and contact information (optional)
If you create an account, we may collect:

- Email address and/or phone number
- Account identifiers (user ID)
- Region and preferred language

You can also use the app without an account but some features may be unavailable (e.g., cloud sync across devices).

### 2) Device and app information
To connect to your IoT devices and support the app, we may collect:

- Device identifiers (device ID, model, firmware version)
- Connectivity metadata (online/offline status, last sync time)
- App version, OS version, device type

### 3) Usage and automation data
Depending on features you enable:

- Schedules and automation rules you create
- Command history (e.g., “turn on”, “run schedule”) for troubleshooting
- Notification preferences

### 4) Sensor and telemetry data (depends on device)
If your hardware supports it:

- Sensor readings (e.g., humidity, temperature, flow, pressure)
- Battery level, power status
- Diagnostic events (e.g., valve error, calibration status)

## How we use your data

We use information to:

- Provide core functionality (connect devices, execute commands, sync settings)
- Maintain security and prevent fraud/abuse
- Send notifications you request (alerts, status changes)
- Diagnose issues, fix bugs, and improve performance

## Sharing and disclosure

We may share limited information with:

- **Infrastructure providers** (hosting, databases, analytics, crash reporting) to operate the service
- **Notification services** to deliver push notifications
- **Legal authorities** if required by law or to protect users and the service

We do **not** sell personal information.

## Data retention

We retain data only as long as needed:

- Account data: while your account is active (or as required by law)
- Device telemetry: retained for a limited period for app functionality and troubleshooting
- Logs: retained for a limited period then deleted or aggregated

## Security

We use industry-standard safeguards such as encryption in transit and access controls. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve protections.

## Your rights and choices

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access your data
- Correct your data
- Delete your account and associated data
- Export certain data

See **Privacy Choices**: [/privacy-choices/](/privacy-choices/)

## Children

The app is intended for a general audience and is not directed to children under 13.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent/guardian
and believe a child provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.

## Changes

We may update this policy. We’ll revise the “Last updated” date above and, when appropriate, notify you in the app.
